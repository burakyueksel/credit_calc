This repository might be useful for you, if:

<ol>
  <li>you living in Germany</li>
  <li>you plan to get a bank credit</li>
  <li>you wonder how long would you need to pay, how much would that mean monthly, considering what credit and "tilgung" percentages </li>
</ol> 

### How do I get set up? ###

* $ python3 credit_calculator.py

* Inputs are hard coded in the .py file.
* It will output a summary in the command line, and also an excel table for convenience.
* Note: there is a 'Tilgung' correction (yearly). You can play with it and see how overall payment time and monthly amount is changing
